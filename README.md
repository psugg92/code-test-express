# Code Test: Peter

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to show my skills!

I have changed the port for the server from 3000 to 4000, if that matters for testing purposes.

To start  my solution please navigate to `code-test-express` and execute `npm install` and then `npm start` to begin the server.

In a new terminal window, navigate to `code-test-express/client/carney-test` and execute `npm install` and then `npm start` to begin the react frontend.
